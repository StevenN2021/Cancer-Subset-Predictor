# Cancer-Subset-Predictor-

This project aims to develop a machine learning pipeline for predicting cancer subtypes based on gene expression data in the form of an RNAseq counts matrix. It includes [data preprocessing](https://github.com/StevenN2021/Cancer-Subset-Predictor/blob/main/notebooks/preprocess.ipynb)), [exploratory data analysis](https://github.com/StevenN2021/Cancer-Subset-Predictor/blob/main/notebooks/eda.ipynb#:~:text=eda.-,ipynb,-preprocess.ipynb), and model training + deployment using the random forest classifier.
